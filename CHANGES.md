and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Implemented advanced connection management features:
  - Connection pooling with configurable pool size, connection reuse, validation, and cleanup
  - Connection timeouts and retries with exponential backoff
  - Automatic reconnection with event-based triggers and operation queuing
  - Connection string parsing with support for connection options
- Pagination support across all query methods with `page(number, size)` method
- Made dependencies optional: signals (blinker) and jupyter (notebook) can now be installed separately
- Added `PaginationResult` class for enhanced pagination with metadata
- Added new field types: EmailField, URLField, IPAddressField, SlugField, ChoiceField
- Added proper logging system with SurrealEngineLogger class
- Added native SurrealDB type support with LiteralField and RangeField
- Enhanced SetField to ensure uniqueness during validation
- Added TimeSeriesField for time series data with metadata support
- Added materialized views support with MaterializedView class and Document.create_materialized_view method
- Enhanced materialized views with support for aggregation functions (count, mean, sum, min, max, array_collect) and custom field selection
- Added `get_raw_query()` method to BaseQuerySet to get the raw query string without executing it, allowing for manual execution or modification of queries
- Added `execute_raw_query()` and `execute_raw_query_sync()` methods to MaterializedView to execute raw queries against materialized views
- Added field-level indexing with `indexed`, `unique`, `search`, and `analyzer` parameters
- Added support for multi-field indexes with the `index_with` parameter
- Added aggregation pipelines with the `AggregationPipeline` class for complex data transformations
- Added additional aggregation functions: Median, StdDev, Variance, Percentile, Distinct, GroupConcat
- Added automatic reference resolution with `Document.get(dereference=True)` and `Document.resolve_references()` methods
- Added JOIN-like operations with `QuerySet.join()` method for efficient retrieval of referenced documents
- Enhanced RelationField with `get_related_documents()` method for bidirectional relation navigation

### Changed
- Updated README.md with instructions for installing optional dependencies
- Improved pagination ergonomics with the `page(number, size)` method
- Marked "Implement schema registration with SurrealDB" as completed in tasks.md
- Removed JSONField and replaced it with DictField for better functionality and consistency
- Refactored fields.py into a directory structure with separate modules for better organization and maintainability

### Fixed
- Fixed pagination support to work with all query methods, not just filter()
- Enhanced ReferenceField to properly handle RecordID objects
- Fixed DictField nested field access in queries using double underscore syntax (e.g., `settings__theme="dark"`)
- Added support for nested fields in DictFields when using schemafull tables
- Fixed IPAddressField to properly handle the 'version' parameter for backward compatibility
- Fixed issue with docstring comments in create_table method causing parsing errors
- Removed debug print statements and commented-out code for cleaner codebase
